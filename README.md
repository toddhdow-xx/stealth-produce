Sector 2015 presentation - Stealth Attack From The Produce Aisle

Title: Stealth Attack From The Produce Aisle
Synopsis: Our presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of the offensive and defensive capabilities of some current low-cost ARM-based computers, including the Raspberry Pi, Cubox and Hummingboard.
Description:
The proliferation of devices like the Raspberry Pi, Pineapple Express, PwnPi and more make it easier (and cheaper) than ever to obtain a complete stealth attack or defense arsenal.

In this session, we'll take a low-cost, credit-card sized ARM computer, add some freely available software and see what we get. We'll learn:
* what options are available to build such a device
* how to build a working device
* add-ons including additional network adapters and wireless extenders
* overview of some commonly available software tools
* how to conduct attack and defense scenarios

Hardware will include Cubox, Hummingboard, Raspberry Pi and more. Software will include Kali Linux and a multitude of offensive and defensive infosec tools.

You'll come away from this session with a better understanding of how much you can accomplish with one of these devices and a healthier respect (or greater fear) of tiny computers.

Reason why this material is innovative or significant and/or how you think attendees will be able to apply the knowledge:
Small, low-cost, low-power and highly portable and powerful devices are becoming more prevalent every day. This means that highly sophisticated offensive and defensive IT security functionality is becoming more prevalent to the good and the bad guys every day as well. Awareness is the first step in understanding the current threat landscape introduced by these devices. Learning how to adapt to and defend against these threats is important. We will offer timely, informative, entertaining and highly relevant information that attendees will be able to take away and apply immediately.
