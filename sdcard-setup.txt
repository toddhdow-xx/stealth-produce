What are the steps required to efficiently image, resize, etc. sdcards for use?

The steps I have used in the past are as follows (are these ideal, or can we optimize this?):
To flash an image:
http://www.solid-run.com/wiki/Flash_an_image#OS_X
mount
sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1*
sudo dd if=kali-1.0.9-cubox-i.img of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=4096
(control+T to see progress of image creation)

Insert disk into cubox-i4pro, plug in peripherals and power it up. Voila!

INCREASE PARTITION SIZE
source: http://askubuntu.com/questions/116351/increase-partition-size-on-which-ubuntu-is-installed

I have 1 drive with two partitions:
/dev/mmcblk0p1
/dev/mmcblk0p2

Note, for the below steps: data is not written to the disk until you write the changes to the disk in the las step.

1. sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
 a) use p to list the partitions. Make note of the start cylinder of /dev/mmcblk0p2
 b) use d to delete first the second partition (2) and then the /dev/mmcblk0p2 partition.
 c) use n to create a new primary partition. Make sure its start cylinder is exactly the same as the old /dev/mmcblk0p2 used to have. For the end cylinder agree with the default choice, which is to make the partition to span the whole disk.
 d) review your changes, take a deep breath and use w to write the new partition table to disk. You'll get a message telling that the kernel couldn't re-read the partition table because the device is busy, but that's ok.

2. Reboot with sudo reboot. When the system boots, you'll have a smaller filesystem living inside a larger partition.

3. Finally, run resize2fs. Run sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2 - this form will default to making the filesystem to take all available space on the partition.

Voila! All done. Your sd card should now be fully utilized.
